                <li>
                    “Every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.” The best opportunities<br>
                    to focus on are the ones that align with your overall goals,because its better to suffer
                    the pain of discipline than regret.

                    Learning is the beginning of wealth and most of life is lived
                    after your formal education, this means that it is very<br>important for you to keep feeding

                    I believe this book contains many excellent and important life long lessions that can be
                    beneficial to everyone.<br>For me chapter 7 was most thought provoking as it spoke about surrounding
                    yourself with the best people.<br>This chapter really made me pause and thing of the company I keep
                    and examine the type of impact they may have on me,<br>whether it is good or bad? And the chapter encouraged
                    me even more to purse to be in the company of people who will make me better.
